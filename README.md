# Stripe 

This package models Stripe data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/stripe). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nqPBWtH_h_8iVjF9-GselWhIyfLH7dgEk7P92s66eEc).

This package enables you to better understand your Stripe transactions. Its main focus is to enhance the balance transaction entries with useful fields from related tables. Additionally, the metrics tables allow you to better understand your account activity over time or at a customer level. These time-based metrics are available on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly level.

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Stripe source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below. Intermediate models are used to create these output models.

| **model**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Installation Instructions

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration

By default, this package will look for your Stripe data in the `stripe` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Stripe data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  stripe_source:
    stripe_database: your_database_name
    stripe_schema: your_schema_name
```

For additional configurations for the source models, please visit the [Stripe source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source).

### Disabling models

Once you have set up your Stripe connector, it's possible that Fivetran will not sync every table that this package expects. This happens because you either don't use that functionality in Stripe or have actively decided to not sync some tables. In order to disable the relevant functionality in the package, you will need to add the relevant variables. By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`. You only need to add variables for the tables you would like to disable:  

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  stripe:
    using_subscriptions: false          # disable if you do not have the subscription table
    using_invoices: false               # disable if you do not have the invoices table
    using_payment_method: false         # disable if you do not have the payment_method and payment_method_card source tables
```
